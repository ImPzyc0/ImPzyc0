As most repositories contain smaller projects which were made betwenn 14 and 16 for fun,
be aware that the quality of the code varies from project to project. For functional and good projects, consider
the pinned repositories (Especially CwazyKitchen (5000 Lines Java game done in a month using custom APIs), Shooter Game (very technical and functional recoil system) and Kingdoms
(1100+ Downloads online, made it with 14)).

These projects show my proficiency in Java and bigger OOP projects using custom APIs and Library or the Spigot API, my knowledge on server/client communication via TCP or UDP, aswell as my in-dept knowledge on the Unity editor and its features, aswell as gun system in Unity.
Further not published projects contain Python code, Java code from high school assignments and very basic websites.
<br>There is practically no AI code in any projects.</br>
